# Given an array a of n numbers and a count k find the k largest values in the array a.
# Example: a=[5, 1, 3, 6, 8, 2, 4, 7], k=3  ⇒  [6, 8, 7]

# Clarifying Questions:
# Are negative values included in the array?
# We’re returning a list of the largest values?
# If we have a list and the length is less than k, what do we do?

# Naive Solution:
# So we’d probably just sort the list and then get the last numbers of the list of how many ever we want.
